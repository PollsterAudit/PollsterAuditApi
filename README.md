# Pollster Audit API

A very simple script which gets called every hour by a github action cron.  
It populates the [`api` branch](https://github.com/PollsterAudit/PollsterAuditApi/tree/api) which is hosted at https://api.pollsteraudit.ca/ - E.x. [Index](https://api.pollsteraudit.ca/v1/index.json)  

### Running Locally
